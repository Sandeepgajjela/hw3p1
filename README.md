Throughout this segment, I implemented the class HospitalEmployee as a Java file in Eclipse. This contains two protected instance variables: Integer number and string name and
generated the subclasses Nurse and Doctor, each of the segmented has the inherited variables as well as new instance variables for specialty in the case of the doctor and numOfPatients in the case of the nurse. We also implemented a constructor and overrode the toString method for these two classes.
After which I applied a separate constructor and toString method for whether Surgeon class and instance of class called operating that indicates surgeon is currently operating or not.
Initially, I rushed even without code work function and fixed a certain bugs. I noticed a few errors and made the necessary changes, and the code was successfully executed without any errors.
then I began running the code using the work function before, debugged it because when I noticed any errors.
